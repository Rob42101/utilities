## Utility Applications

A few Utility Applications that I use from time to time and which others may also find useful.

All have been developed, by me (unless otherwise stated), in Python3, which I'm sure that you will have heard about, some will use the Tkinter GUI framework, which you may of heard about, and others will have been developed using the PAGE drag-and-drop GUI generator.

### PAGE

If you don't know what PAGE is, then please [visit the SOURCE**FORGE** repo](https://sourceforge.net/projects/page/) for details about PAGE:~ My deepest thanks to both Greg Walters and Don Rozenberg for all their hard work and dedication to PAGE, over the years.

PAGE is a fantastic framework and will save you hours of work, when you need to develop a Tkinter based GUI for your Python3 application. Greg has also produced [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Python-GUI-Programming-PAGE-professional-looking/dp/9355518374) and is always happy to answer any questions that you may have.
